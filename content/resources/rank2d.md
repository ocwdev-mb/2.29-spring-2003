description: This m-file computes the integral of the Green function, g, and of the
  normal derivative of the Green function, dg/dn, over a panel. This m-function works
  in local coordinates for which the "source panel" is approximated as a line on a
  local x-axis with the center of the line at the local origin. The "field point"
  is at (x,y) in local coordinates. The normal vector to the panel is in the positive
  local y-direction.
